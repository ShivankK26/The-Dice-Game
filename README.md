# The-Dice-Game
In this project, I've built a Web Page where there are two Players assigned as Player 1 and Player 2 with one dice each. As you refresh the Web Page the dice rolls automatically and the Player which gets the bigger number becomes the winner and that person's name is displayed at the top.
